This theme is a personal project :

* Tropical Sky supports syntax for Javascript,HTML,CSS and Python (C/C++ is in current development, however, this theme does support it)
* The extension is in its infancy and will be properly maintained, modified and improved over time. 
* Take a look at the screen shots below. 

Future Development :
