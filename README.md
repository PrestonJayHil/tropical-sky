# Tropical Sky for Visual Studio Code 
## About
This theme is a personal project :

* Tropical Sky supports syntax for Python but works decently well for Javascript/Html/Css.
* C/C++ is in current development, however, this theme does support those languages and others
* The extension is in its infancy and will be properly maintained, modified and improved over time. 
 

Future Development :
* Overwhelming red color in javascript syntax this issue will be fixed in the next update 
* Improve support for C/C++, PHP next
* Improve existing support. 
* Create a light theme. 


**Enjoy!**

Javascript / HTML / CSS
